# Script by Isabel Huckaby
#
# a letter replacement game
# uses 4 additional files to operate correctly:
# file 1: "newgame"
# file 2: "newgame1"
# file 3: "qanswer"
# file 4: "scrambled"

# flow:
#
# screen clears
# file, scrambled is copied and overwrites file, newgame. This is done because users answers
# are also overwriting newgame as the game is being played. Once the game is over and the script
# is restarted, newgame is refreshed to the start of the puzzle.
#
# menu asks user if they want to play, see answer, or quit.
# see answer, shows file, qanswer
# quit routes user back to main menu in final script, "shortscript"
#
# user is asked to choose a letter to replace, that letter is assigned to variable, old.
# user is asked to choose a new letter to replace the old letter with.
# User is asked to make the new letter CAPITAL. This avoids duplication of letters that were meant to be different answers.
# new letter is assigned to variable, new.
# using the 'tr' command, varibale "old" is replaced with varible "new" in file "newgame" and is saved to overwrite "newgame1"
# this method is used because if the user tries to overwrite the same file, it turns up empty as a result of an overwrite,noclobber error.
# process is repeated, switching the order of newfile and newfile1 overwriting eachother.
