#Made by: Isabel Huckaby
#
# This game keeps track of score as well as:

# randomizes phrases when player loses a round
# randomizes points given and lost when game is in play
# randomizes the result, but tells the player what the result was, and the answer they chose
# records users name and score into a score board
# Needs following files to run correctly:
# file 1: "parts" :  file that contains lines to randomize as responces.
# file 2: "sorry : random line from "parts" is moved into "sorry". "sorry" is then called to show contents, as a responce to users wrong guess.
#
# Scoreboard for this game is file, "htscoreboard"
#
